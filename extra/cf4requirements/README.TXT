After having received a request related to adding Priority
attribute to requirements, I've done a minor search about
common requirements attributes.
Choice has been provide custom fields that can be useful.
Here you will find these custom fields on the TestLink
Custom fields XML format ready to be imported and used.

Hope can be useful.
